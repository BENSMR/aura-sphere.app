## 🔧 Key Setup Steps

**Before Testing:**
```bash
# 1. Set OpenAI API key (REQUIRED)
firebase functions:config:set openai.key="sk-YOUR-API-KEY"

# 2. Verify it's set
firebase functions:config:get

# 3. Monitor logs
firebase functions:log --follow
```

**During Testing:**
```bash
# 1. Start app
flutter run

# 2. Navigate: CRM screen → Select contacts → Generate insights

# 3. Verify results in Firebase Console
# Check: users/{uid}/tasks with autoGenerated == true

# 4. Check TasksListScreen
# Navigate: Tasks screen → See tasks appear in real-time
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

All of these should be true:

- ✅ CRM Insights appear in 10-30 seconds
- ✅ Tasks created automatically in Firestore
- ✅ Each task has userId field (security requirement)
- ✅ Tasks appear in TasksListScreen immediately
- ✅ 📱 icon visible for AI-generated tasks
- ✅ Reminders process every 5 minutes (Cloud Scheduler)
- ✅ Queue entries created in task_queue collection
- ✅ No errors in firebase functions:log

## 🆘 If Tests Fail

1. **Check function logs:**
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log --limit 50
   ```

2. **Look for these error messages:**
   - "OpenAI API key not configured" → Set API key
   - "OpenAI API failed" → Check API key validity
   - "Failed to parse AI response" → See crm_insights_fix_guide.md
   - "Firestore rules violation" → Check userId field

3. **Verify setup:**
   ```bash
   # Is OpenAI key set?
   firebase functions:config:get
   
   # Are functions deployed?
   firebase functions:list
   
   # Is TaskProvider registered?
   grep "TaskProvider" lib/app/app.dart
   ```
